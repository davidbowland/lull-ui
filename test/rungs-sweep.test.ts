// THE ONE PLACE THE THREE HINT LADDERS ARE SWEPT AGAINST PUZZLES lull-api CAN ACTUALLY EMIT. Each
// board's own rungs.test.ts drives its builder over the states that board reaches; this file drives
// all three over the STRUCTURAL CORNERS of the generators upstream, which is a different question and
// the one a board's test cannot ask.
//
// IT MOVED HERE WITH THE RULES. It was lull-api's __tests__/unit/rules/hint-sweep.test.ts, and there
// it was the reason those builders were allowed to sit in a vendored src/rules/ at all: lull-api
// ships none of these hints, so nothing else over there executed the files. The rules are lull-ui's
// now, and the sweep had to travel or the coverage would simply be gone. It stays a TEST rather than
// a gate in the generators for the reason it always was: a hint that does not ship must never be able
// to cost a player a puzzle, and a redraw triggered by an unhappy hint would do exactly that.
//
// IT RUNS PARTLY-ESTABLISHED PLAYER STATES, NOT JUST EMPTY ONES, and that is the difference between
// a sweep and a formality. Against an empty state these builders provably cannot return null --
// every cipher letter is unmapped, every entry unsolved, and a phrase of at most thirty letters
// leaves most of the alphabet absent -- so a sweep that only ever passes `{}` asserts three rungs in
// the one state where three are guaranteed. Both of the bugs this file now covers, a barren pool
// killing every later rung and three rungs stacking onto one entry, were invisible to it.
//
// THE FIXTURES SIT AT THE REAL STRUCTURAL CORNERS, read off lull-api's committed gates rather than
// invented. Cryptogram: MAX_TEXT_LENGTH 80, MIN_WORDS 2 and MAX_WORDS 6 in services/phrases.ts, plus
// MIN_LETTERS 12 and 6-20 distinct in generators/cryptogram/difficulty.ts. Phrazle: 2-6 words of
// 2-11 letters totalling at most 30, in generators/phrazle/difficulty.ts. Themed Anagrams: 5-9
// letters in generators/themedanagrams/words.ts.
//
// EVERY ONE OF THOSE NUMBERS WAS READ OFF THE COMMITTED GATE, because two successive drafts of this
// file guessed instead. The first swept `ARROW` as a one-word cryptogram and `EXTRAORDINARY THING` as
// a long Phrazle, neither of which any generator can produce. The second replaced them with corners
// derived from a Phrazle floor of "2-3 words of 3-7 letters totalling 18" that no version of that
// repo has ever held -- so the ceiling rows sat four letters below the real one, and the rung cap
// they were meant to defend was derived from the same invented number.

// TRANSCRIBED FROM lull-api's GATES, AND NOTHING PINS THEM ANY MORE. While this file lived in
// lull-api it imported MAX_WORD_LETTERS from `@generators/phrazle/difficulty` and MIN_WORD_LENGTH and
// MAX_WORD_LENGTH from `@generators/themedanagrams/words`, so a gate that moved moved this file with
// it. Those paths do not exist here and cannot be made to -- this repo generates nothing -- so the
// three numbers below were read off the committed gates on the day of the move and are now claims
// about another repo that nothing in this one can check.
//
// THAT IS THE STANDING THE OTHER NINE NUMBERS IN THIS FILE ALREADY HAD, which is why the arrangement
// is stated rather than apologized for. Cryptogram's MAX_TEXT_LENGTH, MIN_WORDS and MAX_WORDS, its
// MIN_LETTERS, MIN_UNIQUE and MAX_UNIQUE, and Phrazle's MIN_WORDS, MIN_WORD_LETTERS and
// MAX_TOTAL_LETTERS are module-private over there and were always transcriptions in the comments
// beside the rows they justify. The move took three numbers from the stronger footing to the weaker
